To use easy tags, just enter into the editor
(Admin > Presentation > Easier Theme Editor).

The text box will automatically convert back and forth between
the PHP functions that drive the theme and the easily edited
HTML-like tags.  You can also add your own tags and easily
customize your theme.  Note that no changes will be made until
you save the file.

Like with other systems, tags that start and end with dollar signs
are tags that echo something out.  More precisely, they're replaced
with PHP functions.  Those without dollar signs are containers
and may or may not actually correspond to PHP code.

So the format is:
<ContainerTag [attributes]>content</ContainerTag>
<$Tag [attributes]$>

Attributes work just like in HTML:
<$EntryTitle before="<h2>" after="</h2>"$>
Note that this example is contrived.  It would be better to do:
<h2><$EntryTitle$></h2>
Also note that the before and after attributes have been
removed.  I'll have to come up with a better example.

Attributes are usually (always?) optional.  Space after the tag is
unnecessary if you don't use attributes.  I know all of this stuff
is HTML 101, but I want this to be pretty easy for anyone.

Currently, tags and attributes are case-sensitive, and (double)
quotes around attributes are required.  That may change in the
future, though all it will really do is add bloat and perhaps
bugs to the code.

Currently implemented tags:
<$EntryAuthor$>
	The author of the current entry or blog.
	Attributes: None
<$EntryTitle$>
	The title of the current entry or blog.
	Attributes:
	lang
		Does nothing.  Must be "en".

<TranslatableString>
	A string to be translated.  It is to be used alone and
	not in attribute values nor nested in other tags.

ISSUES
Currently, tag and attribute names are case sensitive.  That may
change in the future, but be cautious for now.
