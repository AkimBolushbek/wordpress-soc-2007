This file is called specs.txt for no particular reason.

It's the technical details of what I do, how I do it and so on.

It's meant for my mentor, but anyone wanting to hack my plugin
(after it becomes public) might find the information useful.

THE TAGS
See tags.txt.  I'm putting them in that file because users (not
just hackers) might find them useful.

THE FUNCTIONING
Right now, eztagsmediator.php contains two routines: ez2std()
for converting easy tags to PHP functions and std2ez() for doing
the reverse.

The actual conversion functions are in eztags_fromstandard.php
and eztags_tostandard.php.  The from-standard functions are
by far the most complex and, therefore, most likely extremely
buggy.
