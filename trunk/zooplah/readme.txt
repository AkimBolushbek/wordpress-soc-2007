REQUIRED SOFTWARE
Nothing should be required besides a working WordPress install.
I'm currently using WordPress 2.2.1, but the versions 2.1 and
higher should work just fine.  The 2.0.x series should also work,
with the caveat that some PHP functions changed between 2.0.x and
2.1, and so the tags may not quite work as advertised.
I'm recommending 2.1 or higher (the latest stable version should
be used for security reasons).

INSTALLING THE PLUGIN
Just like any plugin. Drop into your wp-content/plugins directory
or a subdirectory thereof.

GETTING A NEWER VERSION
Sorry, "versions" aren't available yet.  You'll have to check it
out from
http://wordpress-soc-2007.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/zooplah/
for the time being.  Of course, this plugin is in-development and
I wouldn't recommend trying it out yet.  It's not even open to
testers yet.

CUSTOMIZING YOUR THEME WITH EASY TAGS
See tags.txt.  It's actually quite easy.

IMPROVING THE PLUGIN
See specs.txt for how the plugin works.  If you want to make it
better, then by all means*...  Note:  For everyone's sake, please
wait until after Summer of Code 2007 (let's say, until September).
The plugin won't be done before then and I'm sure my mentor won't
like it not being completely my work.  But after that, I'll be
glad if someone likes my plugin, finds it useful and wants to
improve it.

IF A THEME DOESN'T WORK
That's a very real possibility.  Please don't report bugs or do
anything to your plugin until after Summer of Code 2007.  Before
then, the plugin will be considered unfinished and subject to
major modifications, improvements, etc.  However, after that
time, two courses of action are possible.

One is to submit a bug.  However, if this thing only affects one
theme, it probably will be easier to change the theme to a more
coherent format.  That will help on both our sides.

* LICENSING
This plugin is licensed under the GPL.  It had to be.  I personally
like the BSD-style licenses better.  They give you more freedom, I
think and require that you indicate the origin of your code (that
I wrote the original code).  But I wasn't given a choice in the
matter.

The full text is available in your WordPress install, on gnu.org,
and if you use third-party free software, probably in hundreds of
places on your computer.
