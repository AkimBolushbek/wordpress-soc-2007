This file is called specs.txt for no particular reason.

It's the technical details of what I do, how I do it and so on.

It's meant for my mentor, but anyone wanting to hack my plugin
(after it becomes public) might find the information useful.

THE TAGS
See tags.txt.  I'm putting them in that file because users (not
just hackers) might find them useful.

THE FUNCTIONING
Right now, renard/includes/renard-mediator.php contains two
routines: ez2std() for converting easy tags to PHP functions and
std2ez() for doing the reverse.

The actual conversion functions are in eztags-from-standard.php
and eztags-to-standard.php.  The from-standard functions are
by far the most complex and, therefore, most likely to be
buggy.
