0.1 (target date: 2007-09-09)
1. Implement what my mentor wants me to do (before 2008-08-20):
	a) Tags for empty loops.
	b) Support for tags with more than one parameter.
	c) Finish supporting the tags that are mandatory for any
	   theme.
	d) Allow plugin authors to bind their own tags to custom
	   functions.
2. Release a test build to the WordPress-Soc group to get
   feedback, and implement and fix things I deem worthy.
3. Reorganize the files and directories to be more intuitive to
   those who might download it.
4. Create a screenshot and describe it.
5. Release a test build to the public.
6. Create a Makefile.  It should generate an HTML README file
   (from readme.txt) using Markdown, merge all the PO files with
   the master POT file and convert the PO files into MO files,
   and create a zip file.
7. Use more esoteric Markdown features, since the primary README
   file is going to be the HTML version.
8. Link to the HTML README, tags listing, and caveats from
    ez-tagssubpanel.php.
9. Collect things that the public testers say and try to fix the
    ones in the scope of the project.
10. Accept donations through PayPal.
11. Come up with a decent name for the plugin and change all
    references from the old name to the new name.
