This file is called specs.txt for no particular reason.

It's the technical details of what I do, how I do it and so on.

It's meant for my mentor, but anyone wanting to hack my plugin
(after it becomes public) might find the information useful.

THE TAGS
See tags.txt.  I'm putting them in that file because users (not
just hackers) might find them useful.

THE FUNCTIONING
Right now, eztagsproxy.php contains two routines: ez2std()
for converting easy tags to PHP functions and std2ez() for doing
the reverse.  I'm stripping away the PHP markers and doing a
search and replace.  However, I intend to give the system an
overhaul soon, so I'll likely have to totally rewrite this
section.  I'll elaborate when I do.
