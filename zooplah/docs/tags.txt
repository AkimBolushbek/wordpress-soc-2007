To use easy tags, just enter into the editor
(Admin > Presentation > Easier Theme Editor).

The text box will automatically convert back and forth between
the PHP functions that drive the theme and the easily edited
HTML-like tags.  You can also add your own tags and easily
customize your theme.  Note that no changes will be made until
you save the file.

Like with other systems, tags that start and end with dollar signs
are tags that echo something out.  More precisely, they're replaced
with PHP functions.  Those without dollar signs are containers
and may or may not actually correspond to PHP code.

So the format is:
<ContainerTag [attributes]>content</ContainerTag>
<$Tag [attributes]$>

Attributes work just like in HTML:
<$EntryTitle lang="en"$>

Attributes are usually (always?) optional.  Space after the tag is
unnecessary if you don't use attributes.  I know all of this stuff
is HTML 101, but I want this to be pretty easy for anyone.

Currently, tags and attributes are case-sensitive, and (double)
quotes around attributes are required.  That may change in the
future, though all it will really do is add bloat and perhaps
bugs to the code.

Currently implemented tags:
<$CommentAuthorLink$>
	Link to the website of the author of the current comment,
	if he or she has one.
	Attributes: None
<$CommentID$>
	The ID of the current comment.
	Attributes: None
<$CommentText$>
	Text of the current comment.
	Attributes: None
<$EntryAuthor$>
	The author of the current entry or blog.
	Attributes: None
<$EntryID$>
	The ID of the current entry.
	Attributes: None
<$EntryPermalink$>
	The URL of the current entry.
	Attributes: None
<$EntryTitle$>
	The title of the current entry or blog.
	Attributes:
	lang
		Does nothing.  Must be "en".
<$LanguageAttributes$>
	The HTML attributes for the proper display of the content,
	based on the server computer's locale.
	Attributes: None
<$WPLoginOut$>
	Provide a link to the log-in or log-out page, depending
	on your log-in status.
	Attributes: None

<TranslatableString>
	A string to be translated.
	Attributes: None
	Notes:
		The content of this tag is a string contained in
		the localization table (e.g. eo.po).
		Converting the PHP function to this tag is
		extremely buggy right now.

NOTES
1. Currently, tag and attribute names are case sensitive.
   That may change in the future, but be cautious for now.
2. Not all PHP is converted.
3. PHP sections start with <?php and ends with ?>.  Easier
   template tags must be placed outside of PHP sections.  It's
   best to only use easier template tags in areas where others are
   present.
4. Clarification: There must be no spaces in the less-than
   sign, dollar sign and tag name.  Similarly, there must be no
   space before the final dollar sign or between the final dollar
   sign and the final greater-than sign.  If there's no dollar
   sign in the tag, the same rules apply according to logic: no
   space before the initial less-than-sign or after the final
   greater-than sign.
