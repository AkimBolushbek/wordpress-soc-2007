To use easy tags, just enter into the editor
(Admin > Presentation > Easier Theme Editor).

The text box will automatically convert back and forth between
the PHP functions that drive the theme and the easily edited
HTML-like tags.  You can also add your own tags and easily
customize your theme.  Note that no changes will be made until
you save the file.

Like with other systems, tags that start and end with dollar signs
are tags that echo something out.  More precisely, they're replaced
with PHP functions.  Those without dollar signs are containers
and may or may not actually correspond to PHP code.

So the format is:
<ContainerTag>content</ContainerTag>
<$Tag$>

Some tags contain parameters.  The syntax is:
TagName:parameter

The parameter can be empty, in which case the colon is still
required.  In tags without parameters, the colon is forbidden
(for the obvious reason that the colon marks the beginning of a
parameter).

Theoretically, tags with multiple parameters can exist, but there
are none currently implemented.  The syntax most likely is:
TagName:parameter1:parameter2:parametern:...

Currently, tags and parameters are case-sensitive.  That may
change in the future, though all it will really do is add bloat
and perhaps bugs to the code.

NOTES
1. PHP sections start with <?php and ends with ?>.  Easier
   template tags must be placed outside of PHP sections.  It's
   best to only use easier template tags in areas where others are
   present.
2. Clarification: There must be no spaces in the less-than
   sign, dollar sign and tag name.  Similarly, there must be no
   space before the final dollar sign or between the final dollar
   sign and the final greater-than sign.  If there's no dollar
   sign in the tag, the same rules apply according to logic: no
   space before the initial less-than-sign or after the final
   greater-than sign.
