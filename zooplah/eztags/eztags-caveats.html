		<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
		<p><cite>Easier Template Tags</cite> doesn't use a real <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_Parser"><abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> parser</a>.  The PHP parser isn't compatible with some of the PHP versions that WordPress has sworn to support.  Maybe after Summer of Code, when I'm no longer bound to the requirements of WordPress, I can experiment with it (or maybe not).</p>
		<p>What this means is that the search-and-replace system has several shortcomings.  Sure, they could be overcome by adding more code, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.  I'm just warning you about the known limitations to avoid while I focus on more important areas.</p>
		<p>Don't use a dollar sign, a less-than sign, a colon, or a comma in arguments, attributes, or content (however, named and numerical character references may be used).  Those are very likely to mess everything up.</p>
		<p>Converting everything from PHP to easy tags isn't completely bug-free, especially on non-standard themes.  If the theme abides by <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards">the WordPress coding standards</a>, there's far less room for error (Kubrick has far fewer problems than Classic, in fact).  If there's anything that doesn't look right, don't save it before editing it to where it does looks right.  The theme will then be saved in a format that can be reread.</p>
		<h2 id="php-notes">PHP Notes</h2>
		<p>Authors that are using PHP, please note some limitations and use the following guidelines to save users of my plugin a lot of grief.  Only use single quotes for arguments and don't use variables or functions in them (if for no other reason than to not confuse non-programmers).  Avoid unneeded whitespace and optional arguments.</p>
		<h2 id="future">The Future</h2>
		<p>I consider these minor problems and gotchas.  They're things the code can't yet handle and I'm aware of them.  They are not bugs.  They're just cases of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_cycle#Beta">beta software</a> that hasn't yet been coded with error detection and recovery.  I don't expect these to be issues forever, but I do consider them to be more minor than some other areas and I don't intend to spend a lot of time on them when more important matters are more deserving of my time.</p>
