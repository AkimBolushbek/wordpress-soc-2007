To use easy tags, just enter into the editor
(Admin > Presentation > Easier Theme Editor).

The text box will automatically convert back and forth between
the PHP functions that drive the theme and the easily edited
HTML-like tags.  You can also add your own tags and easily
customize your theme.  Note that no changes will be made until
you save the file.

Like with other systems, tags that start and end with dollar signs
are tags that echo something out.  More precisely, they're replaced
with PHP functions.  Those without dollar signs are containers
and may or may not actually correspond to PHP code.

So the format is:
<ContainerTag [attributes]>content</ContainerTag>
<$Tag [attributes]$>

Attributes work just like in HTML:
<$EntryTitle before="<h2>" after="<h2>"$>

Attributes are usually (always?) optional.  Space after the tag is
unnecessary if you don't use attributes.  I know all of this stuff
is HTML 101, but I want this to be pretty easy for anyone.

Currently, tags and attributes are case-sensitive, and (double)
quotes around attributes are required.  That may change in the
future, though all it will really do is add bloat and perhaps
bugs to the code.

Currently implemented tags:
<$EntryTitle$>
	The title of the current entry/blog.
	Attributes:
	before (optional)
		Text to display before the title.
	after (optional)
		Text to display after the title.
	display (optional)
		Whether to display the title. (I'm not sure if
		I should support this or not, since it's only
		useful if you want to use the output in PHP.)

<Entries>
	Contains information about each entry.
	Attributes: None.
<NoEntries>
	Contains the text to display if no entry is found.
	Attributes: None

ISSUES
Currently, tag and attribute names are case sensitive.  That may
change in the future, but be cautious for now.
