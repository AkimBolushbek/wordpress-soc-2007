		<p>Making your own theme with Renard should be easy.  First, create a new directory in wp-content/themes; let us name it, foobar.  In the foobar directory, create an index.php file that contains your theme.  See <a href="tags.txt">the list of available tags</a> to see what you can do to customize the theme.</p>
		<p>Now, you should use the &lt;$Load*$&gt; tags to help keep your source clean; for example, use &lt;$LoadSidebar$&gt and have your sidebar code in sidebar.php.  The only only thing you really need in index.php, however, is the loop:  &lt;$WPEntriesLoop$&gt and family.</p>
		<p>You also need to create a style.css file that contains information about your theme.  See the existing themes' style.css files for an example.</p>
		<p>More information about making themes is available on the official <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development">theme development</a> page.</p>
