As far as I'm concerned, I'm finished.  I'm ready to make a public
release, get downloads, occasionally implement new features and
fixes, etc.  But here's my list of things I want to do before that
time.

1. Implement what my mentor wants me to do:
	a) Tags for empty loops.
	b) Merge <$WPIfEntries$> and <$WPEntriesLoop$> into a
	   single tag (maybe, depending on my mentor's feedback
	   on my existing implementation).
	c) Support for tags with more than one parameter.
	d) Finish supporting the tags that are mandatory for any
	   theme.
	e) Allow plugin authors to bind their own tags to custom
	   functions.
2. Release a test build to the public to get feedback.
3. Evaluate feedback from testers and implement and fix things I
   deem worthy.
4. Reorganize the files and directories to be more intuitive to
   those who might download it.
5. Create a screenshot and describe it.
6. Create a script to convert tags.txt into interlinked
   documentation.
7. Create a Makefile.  It should run that script, generate an HTML
   README file (from readme.txt) using Markdown, merge all the PO
   files with the master POT file and convert the PO files into
   MO files, and create a zip file.
8. Use more esoteric Markdown features, since the primary README
   file is going to be the HTML version.
9. Link to the HTML README, tags listing, and caveats from
   ez-tagssubpanel.php.

28. Accept donations through PayPal.

42. Come up with a decent name for the plugin and change all
    references from the old name to the new name.
